# Pong
Pong game using C++ and Raylib.

The game contains core Pong functionality. 

Menu:
The main menu screen allows the player to change the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) which adjusts the ball's speed,  
as well as player rectangle speed and the cpu's speed.

Gameplay:
Gameplay is self explanatory, as it is classic Pong. The game will continue to run until the score limit is met,
the game is terminated, or if P is pressed on the keyboard, which pauses the game in its current state.

Endgame screen: 
The final game screen declares the winner, the score, and the highest score reached.
